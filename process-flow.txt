Process Flow
The process flow outlines the steps from user input to final output, including decision points that determine the path based on the LLM’s analysis. The LLM can decide to provide an AI chat response, execute a function call, or both. Below is a detailed description of each step and its connections.

1. User Speaks
Description: The user initiates the process by speaking, providing input to the system.
Input: Audio captured via the User Interaction Module.
Output: The spoken input is sent to the Speech-to-Text Module.
Next Step: Transcribe Speech to Text.
2. Transcribe Speech to Text
Description: The spoken input is converted into text using a speech-to-text service.
Input: Audio from the User Interaction Module.
Output:
Transcribed text sent to the Chat Component for display.
Transcribed text sent to the LLM for processing.
Next Steps:
Stream the transcribed text to the Chat Component.
Send the transcribed text to the LLM Call step.
3. Text Streamed to Chat Component
Description: The transcribed text is displayed in the chat interface, providing visual feedback to the user.
Input: Transcribed text from the Speech-to-Text Module.
Output: Text displayed in the Chat Component.
Next Step: This is an output step and does not lead to further processing.
4. LLM Call to Determine Function Calls and AI Chat Response
Description: The transcribed text is analyzed by the LLM to determine whether it requires an AI chat response, a function call, or both.
Input: Transcribed text from the Speech-to-Text Module.
Output: A decision indicating one of the following:
AI chat response only
Function call only
Both AI chat response and function call
Next Step: Proceed to the decision point: If AI Chat Response.
5. Decision: If AI Chat Response
Description: This decision point evaluates whether the LLM’s output includes an AI chat response.
Input: LLM’s decision.
Paths:
Yes (AI Chat Response): Proceed to Convert Text to Speech.
No: Skip to the Function Call decision (step 8).
Note: If both an AI chat response and a function call are indicated, the process continues through both paths.
AI Chat Response Path
6. Convert Text to Speech
Description: The AI’s response text is converted into speech for audio playback.
Input: Response text generated by the LLM.
Output: Audio file or stream of the response.
Next Step: Play Audio to User.
7. Play Audio to User
Description: The converted speech is played back to the user via the audio output system.
Input: Audio from the Text-to-Speech Module.
Output: Audio heard by the user.
Next Step: If there is also a function call, proceed to the Function Call path (step 8); otherwise, this completes the AI chat response path.
Function Call Path
8. Decision: If Function Call
Description: This decision point evaluates whether the LLM’s output includes a function call.
Input: LLM’s decision.
Paths:
Yes (Function Call): Proceed to determine the type of function (step 9).
No: If there was an AI chat response, the process is complete; otherwise, no further action is taken.
Note: This step is executed even if an AI chat response was processed, allowing both paths to run when applicable.
9. Decision: If Standard Function or Modifier Function
Description: Determines whether the function call is a standard function or a modifier function.
Input: Function details from the LLM.
Paths:
Standard Function: Proceed to Function Executed.
Modifier Function: Proceed to Modify UI.
10. Function Executed
Description: A standard function is executed based on the user’s input (e.g., fetching data, running a command).
Input: Function details from the LLM.
Output: Function-specific results (e.g., data retrieved, action completed).
Next Step: If there is also an AI chat response, ensure it is handled; otherwise, this completes the function call path for standard functions.
11. Modify UI
Description: The UI is updated according to the modifier function’s specifications (e.g., updating the chat, changing layout).
Input: Modifier function details from the LLM.
Output: Updated UI reflecting the function’s changes.
Next Step: If there is also an AI chat response, ensure it is handled; otherwise, this completes the function call path for modifier functions.
Handling Both Paths
When the LLM provides both an AI chat response and a function call, both paths are executed:

The AI Chat Response Path processes the response text through "Convert Text to Speech" and "Play Audio to User."
Simultaneously, the Function Call Path processes the function call, determining whether it’s a standard function ("Function Executed") or a modifier function ("Modify UI"). This ensures the user receives a conversational reply and any required actions or UI updates.
Flow Summary
Here’s a concise summary of the entire process flow:

User Speaks: The user provides spoken input.
Transcribe Speech to Text: The input is converted to text.
Text Streamed to Chat Component: The text is displayed in the chat UI.
LLM Determines Response and/or Function: The LLM analyzes the text and decides on an AI chat response, a function call, or both.
If AI Chat Response:
Convert Text to Speech: The response text is turned into audio.
Play Audio to User: The audio is played back to the user.
If Function Call:
If Standard Function: The function is executed.
If Modifier Function: The UI is modified.
If Both: Both the AI chat response path and the function call path are executed.
